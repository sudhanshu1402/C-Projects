# Simple Calculator

- This program takes an operator and two operands from the user.
- The operator is stored in variable op and two operands are stored in num1 and num2 respectively.
- Then, switch...case statement is used for checking the operator entered by user.
- If user enters + then, statements for case: '+' is executed and program is terminated.
- If user enters - then, statements for case: '-' is executed and program is terminated.
- This program works similarly for the * and / operators. But, if the operator doesn't matches any of the four character [ +, -, * and / ], the default statement is executed which displays error message.
